# üìà Cryptocurrency Price Predictor

A web application that predicts future cryptocurrency prices using a deep learning (LSTM) model. This tool provides a user-friendly interface to get data-driven insights into the volatile crypto market.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Prediction**: Enter any cryptocurrency ticker symbol available on Yahoo Finance (e.g., `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`).
- **Custom Forecast Period**: Specify the number of days into the future you want to predict.
- **Rich Visualizations**: View interactive plots generated by Matplotlib, including:
  - Historical closing prices.
  - Actual vs. Predicted price comparisons on test data.
  - Future price trend forecasts.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean and simple front-end built with HTML and CSS.

## üß† How It Works

The application follows a simple yet powerful workflow to deliver predictions:

1.  **User Input**: The user enters a cryptocurrency ticker and the number of days to predict via the web interface.
2.  **Data Fetching**: The Flask backend uses the `yfinance` library to download the latest historical price data for the requested cryptocurrency.
3.  **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data is cleaned and scaled. It's then transformed into sequences suitable for the LSTM model.
4.  **Model Prediction**: The pre-trained LSTM model is loaded. It processes the prepared data to forecast prices for the specified number of future days.
5.  **Visualization**: `Matplotlib` generates plots of the historical and predicted data. These plots are saved as images and embedded into the HTML response.
6.  **Display Results**: The Flask server renders the results page, displaying the generated graphs and prediction data to the user.

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<YOUR_USERNAME>/cryptocurrency_price_predictor.git
    cd cryptocurrency_price_predictor
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```sh
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - On Windows:

      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    *(**Important**: First, make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project. If you don't, create one by running this command in your terminal: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Flask server:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Open your browser** and navigate to:
    ```
    [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
    ```

You should now see the application running locally!
